# PBOC-Rescue-Loans-Analysis

This analysis explores the People's Bank of China (PBOC) Rescue Loans dataset, which provides information on PBOC's standing bilateral swap lines and rescue loans provided by Chinese state-owned banks and enterprises to government and government-owned institutions in low- and middle-income countries between 2000 and 2021.

The dataset was imported, and an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to better understand the data, including displaying the first few rows, data summary, dataset information, summary statistics, unique value counts for specific columns, and the number of missing values in each column.

The analysis also visualized which countries received the most "Rescue Loans" from China. A choropleth map was created, showing the total funding received by each country between 1998 and 2022.

Furthermore, the analysis explored the individual organizations that took the "Rescue Loans" from China. A horizontal bar chart was created to display the agencies that received rescue loans from China between 1998 and 2022.

By understanding this data, we can identify which countries or organizations can be financially influenced by China.
